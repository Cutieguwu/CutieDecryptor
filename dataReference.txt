People seem to really dislike long posts. If you have a post that's more than a few paragraphs long, mark my words, Redditors are going to flood in to complain about the length.

Though it's true that some writers would purposefully elongate what could be said with a few sentences to a full-blown article just for the sake of 'creating content', sometimes writers just have to write long in order to go in depth about the points they're trying to make.

If the excuse for hating long articles is that we don't have enough time, I must point out I doubt we're that short on time. I bet most of us read many more short posts once we're done with one. If we have enough time to read many short articles, how come we can't use that time to read just one long article?

I also think the shortage of time is really just an excuse. The real reason is our lack of making an effort. Pro tip: never forget you need to work hard to be rewarded.

If you ask me, I think this is the dangerous trend-posts getting shorter and shorter and us getting lazier and lazier. No matter how skilled we are with keeping things short, there's only so much we can say with a few sentences. If everybody insists on posts being short, we could only communicate less and less.

I hope this post doesn't fall in the tl;dr category. That would be a real shame.~
