Canada Post is refusing to collect firearms that were banned by the federal government in 2020, complicating Ottawa's plans for a buyback program to remove 144,000 firearms from private hands, federal sources say.

The Crown corporation informed the government of its position in a recent letter. It said its decision was based on concerns about its employees' security, according to federal sources who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

One key source of concern being cited by Canada Post is the possibility of staff conflicts with gun owners who have been asked to give up their so-called "assault" or "military-style" weapons, which can no longer be used or sold in Canada.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals promised a buyback program in both the quick 2019 and 2021 elections. The government officially announced the process in 2020 and is now hoping to finalize it before the next general election, set for the fall of 2025.

Federal officials told Radio-Canada they still believe using the postal service would be the "most efficient" and "least costly" way to recover banned weapons such as the AR-15, which cannot be used or sold in Canada since a federal ban was imposed four years ago.

Ottawa's plan is to have owners of banned guns place the unloaded and secured weapons in government-issued boxes and then send them back to the government to be destroyed. The owners would then be financially compensated.

Government sources say they're puzzled by Canada Post's refusal to receive the weapons, since the corporation already delivers guns that are sold online.

The sources insist that "discussions" with Canada Post are ongoing. One possible compromise would see Canada Post transport the weapons without taking charge of receiving them.

"It's a challenge, but we do not think this jeopardizes our timetable or the government's desire to move forward," said one of the federal sources. "We want the discussions to continue."~
